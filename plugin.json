	"longdescription": "Binary Ninja integration for [ScyllaHide](https://github.com/x64dbg/ScyllaHide) by x64dbg. Automatically injects the ScyllaHide DLL when the debugger hits the initial breakpoint, helping bypass anti-debugging techniques commonly found in packed or protected executables.\n\n**Features:**\n- Automatic injection on debug start with status bar progress feedback\n- Manual injection via Plugins > ScyllaNinja > Inject ScyllaHide\n- Intelligent process detection with fuzzy matching\n- Multi-binary support with independent injection state\n- Double-injection prevention\n\n**Setup:**\n1. Download ScyllaHide binaries from https://github.com/x64dbg/ScyllaHide/releases/tag/v1.4\n2. Extract InjectorCLIx64.exe, InjectorCLIx86.exe, HookLibraryx64.dll, HookLibraryx86.dll\n3. Configure in Settings > Debugger > scyllahide\n4. Enable automatic injection and select a profile\n5. Start debugging - ScyllaHide injects automatically\n\nScyllaHide handles PEB manipulation, NT API hooking, and timing protection to hide the debugger from anti-debug checks.",
